# Modern AI Tool Protocol

A proposal for a robust, production-ready protocol for AI tool interactions.

## The Problem

Current AI tool protocols (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) are too simplistic for real-world applications, treating complex operations as simple string-based request/response pairs. We need something better.

## Quick Start

Check out the full specification in [PROTOCOL.md](./docs/PROTOCOL.md).

```typescript
// Current AI Tool Protocols
type CurrentTool = {
  name: string,
  description: string,
  parameters: JSONSchema
}

// Our Proposed Protocol
type ModernTool = {
  version: string,
  documentation: { ... },
  errors: { ... },
  execution: { ... },
  state: { ... }
}
```

## Key Features

- ✨ Rich Documentation
- 🚀 Native Async Support
- 💪 Proper Error Handling
- 📦 State Management
- 🔄 Version Control

## Why This Matters

Current AI tool protocols are holding back real-world AI applications. We need:

1. **Better Error Handling**: Stop treating errors as strings
2. **Proper Async Support**: Long-running operations are the norm
3. **State Management**: Tools have context and side effects
4. **Rich Documentation**: More than just a description string
5. **Version Control**: Tools evolve, we need to handle that
